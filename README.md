# ParkinsonDisease_SpiralDrawing

Using the UCI "Parkinson Disease Spiral Drawings using digitized Graphics Tablet Data Set" (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson+Disease+Spiral+Drawings+Using+Digitized+Graphics+Tablet#) to build an algorithm predicting if the subject has or has not Parkinson Disease.


In 2011, the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine in Istanbul University (Turkey) provided a data set of test results from 62 patients with the Parkinson's disease and 15 from healthy people for a study (Muhammed Erdem Isenkul, Betul Erdogdu Sakar and Olcay Kursun) which purpose was to monitor Parkinson's disease with digitalized graphic tablets. The goal of this study was to provide easy access to Parkinson's disease progress monitoring to the elderly patients, or patients with an advanced stage of the disease, instead of the inconvenient and time-consuming process at the clinic. The tests aim to be non-invasive, would not require brain scans, would ease the work of the medical doctors, and would not require trained medical staff assigned to this task.
